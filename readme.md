#### By Joseph Murray

#### A page that utilizes JavaScript, Web API and event handlers to suggest a starting language for a new coder to attempt to pick up.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Markdown
* Bootstrap

## Description

This page is intended to showcase my understanding of JavaScript to this point. This page asks visitors questions about themselves in order to determine which programming language they'd likely work with best. It uses data collected from select boxes all triggered by a single button to display a customizable paragraph in response.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download my repository to your Desktop
* Open suggestor.html

## Known Bugs

* Difficulty getting CSS formatting to change on demand
